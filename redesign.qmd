<h3>Analysis of Original Visualization 1</h3>

<p>The original graph aimed to show XYZ, but several visual flaws were noted:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Issue 1</strong>: The color scheme is ineffective in differentiating the data categories.</li>

<li><strong>Issue 2</strong>: The use of 3D bars adds unnecessary complexity, making it hard to compare values.</li>

</ul>

### Redesign 1 of Original Visualization 1

<iframe src="assets/Redesign 1-1.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>

**Discussion**: In this redesign, the colors were adjusted to improve differentiation, and 3D effects were removed to make the values easier to compare.

### Redesign 2 of Original Visualization 1

<iframe src="assets/Redesign 1-2.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe> 

**Discussion**: In this redesign, additional grid lines were added, and the data categories were sorted in ascending order to make trends more apparent.

<h3>Analysis of Original Visualization 2</h3>

<p>The original graph attempted to visualize ABC but had the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Issue 1</strong>: Lack of labels makes it difficult to interpret what each axis represents.</li>

<li><strong>Issue 2</strong>: Data points are overplotted, obscuring key trends.</li>

</ul>

### Redesign 1 of Original Visualization 2

<iframe src="assets/Redesign 2-1.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>

**Discussion**: This redesign includes clearly labeled axes, and different point shapes were used to reduce overplotting and improve readability.

### Redesign 2 of Original Visualization 2

<iframe src="assets/Redesign 2-2.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>

**Discussion**: In this version, we used a line plot instead of scatter points to better represent the trend over time.

## Concluding Remarks {#concluding-remarks}

::: card
<p>Through these redesigns, I've aimed to improve both the interpretability and visual clarity of the original visualizations. Specifically:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Original Visualization 1</strong>: The use of better color schemes and simplified design made it easier to understand the categories and their relationships.</li>

<li><strong>Original Visualization 2</strong>: Adding labels and changing the plot type helped convey the key message without overwhelming the viewer.</li>

</ul>

<p>Further steps may include incorporating additional data points for more in-depth analysis or experimenting with interactive visualizations.</p>
