Specifically:\n\n\n\nOriginal Visualization 1: The use of better color schemes and simplified design made it easier to understand the categories and their relationships.\n\n\nOriginal Visualization 2: Adding labels and changing the plot type helped convey the key message without overwhelming the viewer.\n\n\n\nFurther steps may include incorporating additional data points for more in-depth analysis or experimenting with interactive visualizations."
