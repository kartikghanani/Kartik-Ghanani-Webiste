Hi, I'm Kartik Ghanani, and I am currently pursuing my master's in data analytics engineering at George Mason University. Originally from India, I completed my B.Tech from Acropolis Institute of Technology in Indore. I have a passion for exploring and analyzing data, transforming complex datasets into meaningful insights that drive decision-making.

Throughout my journey, I've worked on several projects that showcase my skills in data visualization, statistical analysis, and optimization. Iâ€™m experienced in using tools like R and Python to solve real-world problems and tell compelling data stories, and these projects are a reflection of my growth and capabilities in the field of data analytics.

My goal is to become a skilled data analyst in a reputed company, where I can contribute my expertise and continue learning in the ever-evolving field of data analytics. In my free time, I enjoy playing football, gaming, and table tennis, which helps me stay balanced and energized.

Feel free to explore my projects and redesigned visualizations on this website!
